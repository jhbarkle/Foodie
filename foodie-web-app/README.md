## Description
At this time i've been at my current job for about a year as a Test Engineer. I have finally started the process of switching from testing to a Web Dev and during this transition I want to strengthen my web skills. 

## Tech Overview

This project will utilize React(Next.js), Typescript, HTML, and CSS/SASS.

## Project | Foodie
I did a internship my previous summer to working here fulltime. For that i mainly tested iOS apps. I didn't know swift or anything iOS related so to get up to speed, I built my own iOS app called "What Can I Cook".

This app allowed users to enter random ingredients they might have in their fridge and get a plethora of options they can make using those as well as identifying what ingredients might be missing. It allowed users to save found recipes but that was about it on the feature side of things. I presented that app to a small group from the company. I plan to recreate this app for the web!
